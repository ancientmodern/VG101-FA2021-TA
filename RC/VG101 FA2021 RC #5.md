## What's different in C++?

+ **OOP (Object-oriented programming)**
+ Namespace and scope operator
+ Template
+ **STL: standard template library**

In next two weeks, we will mainly focus on OOP and STL parts.

### Special Notes

C++ may be one of the most complicated popular programming languages. Although you have only taken two courses about C++, I decided to cover a lot (almost everything I think you will encounter in the Hw and Lab) in this RC, since this is possibly the final regular RC this semester.  In addition, I am neither a good teacher nor a master of C++. So probably you may feel hard to follow this RC. Don't worry about this, some concepts also took me a long time to understand when I prepared this RC slide. Feel free to ask us if you have any questions. **Finally, do not forget to practice.**



## Namespace

+ We could declare some scopes with names to store some variables or functions in C++, this scope is called namespace. Identifiers in different namespaces will not interfere with each other.
+ Syntax: 

	```cpp
	namespace scope {
		// ...
	}
	```

+ Variables or functions declared in a certain scope can be accessed by `scope::name`

+ `using` keyword can integrate a namespace into global namespace.

+ Example: `using namespace std;`
+ Although the syntax is similar, `class` is quite different from `namespace`!
  + A **class** is a data type. If you have a class named `Foo`, you can create objects of class `Foo` and use them in many ways.
  + A **namespace** is simply an abstract way of grouping identifiers together.

+ In VG101, I believe you only need to write `class`.



## Reference

+ Pointers are powerful, but they can also be devil if you do not use them properly.

+ We can use `Type &ref = var;` to refer to a variable (notice that `var` cannot be a constant, and we cannot initialize a reference later).

+ ```cpp
  int a = 5;
  int &b = a;
  b = 10;
  std::cout << a << ' ' << b << std::endl;
  // Output: 10 10
  
  const int a = 5;
  int &b = a; // error
  int &c;     // error
  ```

+ Once a reference is created, we can use it as the original `var` .

+ Reference can avoid copy operation when we use big data structures, so it is useful with `class`.

+ ```cpp
  // Pass by value
  void LOAD(Database db) { // Copy an entire Database every time, may be very huge
      db.name = "vg101";   // And this line does not make sense
  }
  
  // C++ style (pass by reference)
  void LOAD(Database &db) {
      db.name = "vg101";
  }
  void SAVE(const Database &db);
  
  // C style (pass by pointer)
  void LOAD(Database *db) {
      strcpy(db->name, "vg101");
  }
  ```



## Standard I/O

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

cout << "Hello " << "World!" << endl; // output: Hello World!
int a, b; 
char c;
cin >> a >> b >> c;          // Read from stdin, separated by white spaces (' ', '\t', '\n')
cout << a << b << c << endl; // Write to stdout (string, char, int. All can be output by cout)
cerr << "Error:" << a << b;  // Write to stderr (no buffer)
```

- `cin` and `cout` free you from the workload of specifying the format; it can automatically transfer the format for you. We will come back to explain how it realize such functions after `class` and overloading
  - Honestly speaking, sometimes I miss the format string... 
  - `printf("%d %d %d %d %d %d %d\n", ...);` will result in a quite long and ugly line using `cout`
  - **Although sometimes a bit ugly, please always use `cout` and `cin` instead of `printf` and `scanf` in C++**
  - [C++20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B20) introduces [`std::format`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format/format), which allows you to use the format string in C++!
    - But you cannot use this feature since we only support C++17
- `endl` is similar to `\n`, plus it flushes the buffer. More specifically, `std::cout << std::endl;` is equivalent to `std::cout << "\n" << std::flush;`
- There are some other functions and libraries (e.g. `getline`, `fstream`) to implement I/O in different situations.

### Stream I/O

`stream` is a commonly used concept in C++ with some special property (e.g. `iostream`, `fstream`, `stringstream`). You can consider `stream` as a pipe, and you can write it with some content from one end, and read the content from the other end of the pipe.

+ `iostream` takes the keyboard (or other input device) as the one end of pipe
+ `fstream` takes the file as one end of pipe
+ `sstream` takes the `string` as one end of pipe

Their general syntax is similar, except for some special methods,

```cpp
istream >> a >> b >> c; // input stream
ostream << "This is the first line" << "\n" 
    << a << "\n" 
    << c << endl; // output stream

string str;
getline(istream, str); // read in the characters of each line until it discovers a newline
```

+ On Lecture 18, Page 11+, Jigang provides a sample usage of the `fstream`.
+ The `draw()` function provided in Lab 7 is a sample usage of the output `stringstream`.



## Procedural Programming vs. Object‐Oriented Programming (OOP)

- Procedural Programming: Everything is considered as a procedure, which means a program is consists of several procedures (e.g. a function to implement some tasks). There is no ownership of data.
- Object‐Oriented Programming: Everything is considered as an object. Data and methods all belong to some specific object (ownership of data).
- Example: Alice kisses Bob,
  - Procedural Programming: The core of this scenario is the procedure, "kiss". What happens is that the "kiss" procedure involves Alice and Bob this time. **Define function as `kiss(Alice, Bob)`.**
  - Object‐Oriented Programming: The core of this scenario is the object, "Alice". Alice is the subject of the sentence, and "kiss" is just one of the methods that Alice can do. **Define function as `Alice.kiss(Bob)`.**
- OOP allow three major beneficial features,
  - Encapsulation (封装): Group data. Data are considered as the property of an object, and the object is responsible for maintaining the data. (e.g. Alice can use some `int` to store her `height`, `weight`, etc.)
  - Inheritance (继承): If an object `A` is an enhanced version of `a`, we can let `A` inherit from `a`. It promotes the code reuse.
  - Polymorphism (多态): If `A1`, `A2`, `A3` are all inherited from `a`, they work like `a` with different extensions. In a view from `a`, it is called polymorphism.
- An example from Lab 4.



## Class

+ ```cpp
  class exampe {
      char name[10];
      int index;
      
      void print();
      
  }
  
  struct eample {
      void func();
  }
  ```

+ 

+ `class` is a complex structure that is composed with multiple variables (called member variable or property) and functions (called member function or method).

+ Compared with `struct` in C, the biggest difference is that `class` can contain functions.

+ `struct` also appears in C++, and the only difference between `struct` and `class` in C++ is that `struct` is **public** by default, while `class` is **private** by default.

+ However, for a good coding style, in C++, it's recommended:
  + use `struct` for plain-old-data structures without any class-like features
  + use `class` when you make use of features such as `private` or `protected` members, non-default constructors and operators, etc.

+ A sample `Vector2` class from Lab 7 (without template),

```cpp
#include <iostream>

class Vector2 {
private:
    int x, y; // private member variables

public:
    Vector2(int _x = 0, int _y = 0) : x(_x), y(_y) { // constructor using initializer lists, with default arguments (default arguments should always be put at the end)
        std::cout << "Constructor is called" << std::endl;
    } 
    
    Vector2(const Vector2 &another) { // copy constructor
        this->x = another.x; // a pointer to the instance itself
        this->y = another.y;
        std::cout << "Copy constructor is called" << std::endl;
    }
    
    ~Vector2() { // destructor
        std::cout << "Destructor is called" << std::endl;
    }
    
    // Some function declartions
    void setX(int _x);
    
    int getX() const; // const member function
    
	// Various operator overloading
    Vector2 operator+(const Vector2 &another) const { return {x + another.x, y + another.y}; }

    Vector2 operator-(const Vector2 &another) const { return {x - another.x, y - another.y}; }

    Vector2 operator*(int multiplier) const { return {x * multiplier, y * multiplier}; }

    Vector2 operator/(int multiplier) const { return {x / multiplier, y / multiplier}; }

    // Why we return a reference instead of value in the following functions?
    Vector2 &operator+=(const Vector2 &another) {
        x += another.x;
        y += another.y;
        return *this; // `this` is a pointer to the instance itself
    }

    Vector2 &operator-=(const Vector2 &another) {
        x -= another.x;
        y -= another.y;
        return *this;
    }

    Vector2 &operator*=(int multiplier) {
        x *= multiplier;
        y *= multiplier;
        return *this;
    }

    Vector2 &operator/=(int multiplier) {
        x /= multiplier;
        y /= multiplier;
        return *this;
    }

    bool operator==(const Vector2 &another) const { return x == another.x && y == another.y; }
};

// For function definitions outside the class, you need add Vector2::
void Vector2::setX(int _x) {
    this->x = _x; // `this` is a pointer!
} 

int Vector2::getX() const {
    return x;
}

int main() {
    Vector2 tankA{1, 2}, tankB{3, 2}; // call the first constructor
    Vector2 tankD = tankA + tankB; // Procedure P: add(tankA, tankB)
   	// OOP: tankA.add(tankB), tankA + tankB
    Vector2 tankE = tankA - tankB;
    // tankA.x = 3; // error, access a private member
    tankA.setX(3); // How to call a class member function?
    std::cout << tankA.getX() << std::endl; // Output: 3
    if (tankA == tankB) {
        Vector2 tankC{tankB}; // call the copy constructor
        tankC += tankA;
        tankC *= 5;
       	std::cout << tankC.getX() << std::endl; // Output: 30
        // tankC ends its life cycle, the destructor will be called
    }
    tankA = tankB * 10;
    std::cout << tankA.getX() << std::endl; // Output: 30
    // tankA and tankB end their life cycles, destructors will be called
}
```

+ The real running output:

+ <img src="C:\Users\ancientmodern\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20211201012118945.png" alt="image-20211201012118945" style="zoom:50%;" />

+ We only declare three `Vector2` objects, but constructor and destructor are both called four times, why?

+ **`tankA = tankB * 10;` Refer to the `operator*`, think about what happens in this line.**

+ The concepts appear above:

  + **How to call a `class` member function?**
    + First declare a `class` object, e.g. `Vector2 tankA;`
    + Then call the member function through the object, e.g. `tankA.setX(3);`
  + Constructor: Called when declaring/initializing a new `class` object. If there is more than one constructors, the compiler will choose one according to the passing arguments.
  + Destructor: Called when the `class` object ends its life cycle.
  + `const` member function: Any member variables of the `class` cannot be changed in this function.
  + `private` members: Can only be accessed by the members of this `class` (or some `friend class`).
  + `public` members: Can be accessed by anyone.
  + `this`: A **pointer** to the instance itself.
  + Operator overloading: Customizes the C++ operators for operands of user-defined types.

+ A sample usage of constructor and destructor:

+ ```cpp
  class DynamicArray {
  private:
      int *arr;
      size_t size;
  
  public:
      DynamicArray(size_t _size) : size(_size) {
          // arr = new int[_size];
          arr = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int) * _size);
      }
  
      ~DynamicArray() {
          // delete[] arr;
          free(arr);
      }
  };
  
  DynamicArray arr1{100};
  ```
  
  

## `std::vector`

STL vector realizes a dynamic array container so that we could use it as normal arrays, plus more functions like `insert()` and `push_back()` to add elements, and `erase()` to remove elements.

+ Pros:

  - fast random access (e.g. `vec[101]`) $O(1)$
  - fast insert/delete at the back (`push_back`, `pop_back`) $O(1)$

+ Cons:

  - inserting / deleting at other position is slow (`insert`, `erase`) $O(n)$

**Believe me, at least in VG101, `vector` can meet all your expectations for an array. So please get familiar with `vector` and frequently use it in your homework/lab.**

+ How to use it?

+ ```cpp
  #include <vector>
  using namespace std;
  
  vector<int> vec1;     // holds int
  vector<Vector2> vec2; // holds Vector2
  vector<string> vec3;  // holds string
  ```

+ Initialization:

+ ```cpp
  vector<T> v1;       // empty vector v1
  vector<T> v2(v1);   // copy constructor, v2 == v1
  vector<T> v3(n, t); // construct v3 that has n elements with value t
  vector<int> v(10, 0);
  int arr[10] = {0};
  ```
  
+ Size:

  + `v.size()` returns a value of `size_type` corresponding to the vector type.
  + Example: `vector<int>::size_type`
    - a companion type of vector (to make the type machine-independent).
    - essentially an **unsigned** type, so it can be directly converted to `unsigned int` but not `int`.
    - `int s = static_cast<int>(v.size());`
  + Check whether the `vector` is empty: `v.empty()`.

+ Add/Remove:

  + `vec.push_back(t)`: add element `t` to the end of `vec`.
  + Elements are copies: no relationship between the element in the container and the value from which it was copied.
  + `vec.pop_back()`: remove the last element in `vec`. `vec` must be non-empty.

+ Other useful operations:

+ ```cpp
  v1 = v2;   // copy assignment
  v.clear(); // clear all elements，size = 0
  v.front(); // The first element of v, must be non-empty
  v[0]
  v.back();  // The last element of v, must be non-empty
  v[v.size() - 1];
  ```

### Iterator

All STL containers define iterator types:

+ Declaration: `vector<int>::iterator it;`

  + `v.begin()` returns an iterator pointing to the first element of vector
  + `v.end()` returns an iterator positioning to **one-past-the-end** of the vector
  + usually used to indicate when we have processed all the elements in the vector
  + If the vector is empty, then `v.begin() == v.end()`

+ Operations:

+ 1 2 3 4

  + Dereference: can read/write through `*iter` (cannot dereference the iterator  `v.end()`)
  + `++iter, iter++`: next iterator (cannot increment the iterator `v.end()`)
  + `--iter, iter--`: go back to the previous iterator

  + `iter == iter1` and `iter != iter1`: check whether two iterators point to the same data item

  ```cpp
  vector<int>::iterator begin = ivec.begin();
  auto end = ivec.end(); // Thanks to C++11.
  while (begin != end) {
    cout << *begin++ << " ";
    // 1. get the value of *begin
    // 2. cout << *begin << " ";
    // 3. begin++;
  }
  ```

+ Iterator Arithmetic
  + `iter + n, iter - n`, where `n` is an integer
  ```cpp
  // Example 1: Go to the middle
  auto mid = v.begin() + v.size() / 2;
  
  // Example 2: Random access through iterator
  auto begin = v.begin();
  cout << *(begin + 7) << endl;
  cout << v[7] << endl; // Same
  ```

+ Relational Operation: `>, >=, <, <=, ==, !=`

  - To compare, iterators must refer to elements **in the same container**.

  ```cpp
  // Example: Traverse a vector through iterator
  for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) {
      cout << *it << endl;
  }
  
  // C++11 style: for-range based loop
  for (auto &item : v) {
      cout << item << endl;
  }
  
  for i in arr:
  	
  ```

+ More about initialization of `vector`

  + `vector<T> v(b,e)`: create vector `v` with a copy of the elements from the range denoted by iterators `b` and `e`. 

  ```cpp
  vector<int> v1(10, 5);
  vector<int> v2(v1);
  vector<int> v3(v1.begin(), v1.end());
  vector<int> v4(5, 5);
  vector<int> v5(v1.begin(), v1.begin() + v1.size()/2);
  // v1, v2, v3 are the same
  // v4, v5 are the same
  ```

  - You can even use array to initialize vector:

    ```cpp
    int a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    unsigned int sz = sizeof(a) / sizeof(int);
    vector<int> vi(a, a + sz); // pointer
    ```

+ More about add/remove:

  + `v.insert(it, t)`, **`it` is an iterator**

    + 1 2 3 4 5
    + it -> 3
    + v.insert(it, 0);
    + 1 2 0 3 4 5
    + Insert an element with value `t` **right before** the element referred to by iterator `it`.

    - Return an iterator referring to the element that was added.
    - rit -> 0

  + `v.erase(it)`, **`it` is an iterator**

    + 1 2 3 4 5
    + it -> 3
    + v.erase(it)
    + 1 2 4 5
    + rit -> 4
    + Remove the element that iterator `it` refers to.
    + Return an iterator referring to the element after the deleted one, or `v.end()` if `it` refers to the last element.



## `std::string`

Besides `std::vector`, C++ also provides an useful string library `<string>`. Also, at least in VG101, I think you can always use `string` rather than C-style string `char[]`.

+ Initialization:

+ ```cpp
  #include <string>
  using namespace std;
  
  string str1 = “blablabla”; // Overload assignment operator
  string str2(“blablabla”);  // Copy constructor
  
  char str[256];
  string 
  ```
  
+ The `string` can automatically store infinite numbers of characters without worrying about memory leak. `cin` and `cout` can also take string as parameters.

+ Other useful and straight-forward operations (No longer anti-human like `strcmp`!)

  + Assignment: 
    + C++ `string`: `str1 = str2;`
    + C-style string: `strcpy(str1, str2);`
  + Concatenate: 
    + C++ `string`: `str3 = str1 + str2;`
    + C-style string: `strcpy(str3, str1); strcat(str3, str2);`
  + Compare: 
    + C++ `string`: `str1 == str2`, `str1 > str2`, ...
    + C-style string: `strcmp(str1, str2) == 0`, ...
    + if (!stcmp)
    + else if 
    + else if
    + 
  + Get length:
    + C++ `string`: `str.length();` or `str.size();` they are the same
    + C-style string: `strlen(str);`
    + This is also an example of the OOP style.
  + Convert to a C-style string (so it’s compatible with C library): `str.c_str();`

+ Actually, `string` is also a STL container like `vector`, so it has the iterator, and some methods similar to the `vector`

  + `opeartor[]`: access string as a char array, e.g. `str[10]` -> char
  + Check whether the `string` is empty: `str.empty()`.
  + Methods quite similar to `vector`: `str.front()`, `str.back()`,`str.push_back`, `str.pop_back()`, ...
  + iterator-based: `str.insert()`, `str.erase()`, ...
  + "I hate VG101" -》 "I hate VG101"
  + "A" + "I hate VG101";
  + "I and he hate VG101".insert(str.begin() + 4, 'and he');
  + Special and useful methods: `str.append()`, `str.substr()`, `str.find()`, ...

+ **There are a lot of methods, you can check them in https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string.**

+ Useful non-member functions:

  - `stoi()`: convert string to number
  - `getline()`: taking a `istream` and a `string` as argument, read a line from `istream` and store it into `string`

+ The best way to get familiar with them: 1. Read the documentation, 2. Try it by yourself!
