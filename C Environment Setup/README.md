# VG101: C/C++ Environment Setup

Thanks to the new toolchain setups supported by [CLion 2021.3](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/whatsnew/#scope-2021-3-toolchains), which has a bundled MinGW, setting up C/C++ environment on Windows now becomes quite simple. Just follow the official guide [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/quick-tutorial-on-configuring-clion-on-windows.html#MinGW). For macOS users, Jetbrains also provides an [official manual](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/quick-tutorial-on-configuring-clion-on-macos.html) to configure CLion. 

Generally, I think there is no need for TAs of VG101 to write a C/C++ environment setup manual by themselves any more. These existing materials are good enough.
